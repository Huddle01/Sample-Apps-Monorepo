To build an Audio Spaces mobile app using Huddle01 Flutter SDK with a well-designed UI, implementing the following features:

Feature to send a request to speak

Step 1: Create a new Flutter project

flutter create audio_spaces
Step 2: Add the Huddle01 Flutter SDK to your project

Open the pubspec.yaml file and add the following dependency:
YAML
dependencies:
  huddle01_flutter_sdk: ^latest
Use code with caution. Learn more
Run the following command to install the Huddle01 Flutter SDK:
flutter pub get
Step 3: Design your UI

Create a new lib/ui/home.dart file and add the following code:

Dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:huddle01_flutter_sdk/huddle01_flutter_sdk.dart';

class
 
HomePage
 
extends
 
StatefulWidget
 
{
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class
 
_HomePageState
 
extends
 
State<HomePage> {
  final Huddle01Client _huddle01Client = Huddle01Client();

  void _sendRequestToSpeak() async {
    await _huddle01Client.sendRequestToSpeak();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Audio Spaces'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Raise your hand to speak'),
            SizedBox(height: 16),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _sendRequestToSpeak,
              child: Text('Send request to speak'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

This code creates a simple UI with a button to send a request to speak. When the user taps the button, the _sendRequestToSpeak() method is called, which uses the Huddle01 Flutter SDK to send a request to speak to the Huddle01 server.

Step 4: Integrate the Huddle01 Flutter SDK

To integrate the Huddle01 Flutter SDK with your app, you need to create a Huddle01Client object and use it to send requests to the Huddle01 server.

In the _sendRequestToSpeak() method, we create a new Huddle01Client object and then use the sendRequestToSpeak() method to send a request to speak.

Step 5: Run your app

To run your app, simply run the following command:

flutter run
Your app will now be running and you should be able to send requests to speak.

Additional features

In addition to the basic feature of sending a request to speak, you can also implement other features in your Audio Spaces app using the Huddle01 Flutter SDK, such as:

Joining and leaving audio spaces
Muting and unmuting your microphone
Playing and pausing audio streams
Viewing a list of participants in an audio space
You can also use the Huddle01 Flutter SDK to create custom user interfaces for your Audio Spaces app.

Conclusion

The Huddle01 Flutter SDK makes it easy to build audio spaces apps for iOS and Android. With a few simple steps, you can create an app that allows users to send requests to speak, join and leave audio spaces, mute and unmute their microphones, play and pause audio streams, and view a list of participants in an audio space.
